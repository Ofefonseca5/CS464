# CS464 Term Project: Human Perspective on Ethical Dilemmas in Artificial Intelligence Systems
### Team Members: Daiana Bilbao, Ofe Fonseca, Maddie Watts
### Software: 3D Unity Project, WebGL
### Project Goal: To crowdsource human opinions/data on ethical dilemmas faced by AI Systems in the context of Self-Driving Cars and in the Medical Field for improving decision making in AI Systems.

# Overview
For our Term Project we decided we wanted to create an experiment using Unity and wanted to explore ethical dilemmas in artificial intelligence, not only with self-driving cars but in other sceanarios as well. The correct ethics is what a group of people consider to be the correct thing to do in an ethical dilemmas so in an attempt to find solutions to ethical dilemmas we decided on making an experiment that would crowdsource human opinions on varying ethical dilemmas. 

# Experiment Design

### Browser Experience 
We wanted to make each sceanario was realistic as possible which is why we decided to create a 3D Unity Project. However, since most don't have access to their own Virtual Reality headset, it wasn't feasible to just make our project in 3D so we have decided to make 'browser mode' our primary mode. It was not a big deal because Unity has provided us with other elements that would make our sceanarios as realistic as possible such as displaying images, audio and adding a timer. The browser experience also allowed anyone with access to a desktop browser to participate in our experiment which was a huge plus!

### Scenario Design
Each scenario included an image with an acompanying audio. Each sceanario was also timed for 45 seconds. Participants had 45 seconds to listen to each audio (which explained the scenario) and to make a decision. We decided to make it timed because in a real-life situation, you do not have a lot of time to make a sacrificing decision so we added the timer to make the sceanarios realistic. Also, studies show that adding time-pressure to decision-making make people be more honest with their decision-making.

### Surveys
We have also added several types of surveys throughout our experiment. Before each participant begins, we ask demographic information so that we can get an idea of our sample in the end so that we may know if our data is skewed towards a certain demographic. The goal is to have a very diverse demographic so that the results can be generalizable. Then, after each sceanario, a series of question are asked about the given sceanario. The goal is to collect the opinions of humans so the questionnaires after each sceanario helped us accomplish that goal.

### Data Collection 
To collect data on decision making choices we are using UnityWebRequest to Post responses to an existing Google Form. This feature allowed us to collect all necessary data about each participant so that we may later analyze it.
